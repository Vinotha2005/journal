2026-02-19,"Before, I usually woke up at 7:30 AM and rushed to finish everything. During that time, I felt very tense and often forgot whether I had taken all my things or not. My mind was always hurried and confused.
But today was different. I woke up at 6:30 AM and got ready for college in a calm and relaxed way. There was no hurry, and my mind felt peaceful. Because of that, I felt more confident and organized.
At 9:00 AM, I spent some quality time working on my internship. I was able to focus better and understand my work clearly. Throughout the day, I reflected on many things about myself and my routine.
And nowI realized that I had not completed my journaling for the past two days. Sir had messaged me about it yesterday, but I did not respond properly. He did not scold me at all. However, instead of admitting my mistake, I kept giving reasons and was unable to clearly accept my fault.
Our conversation was very useful. Even though sir has known me only for the past one month through online classes, he understands me very well. He clearly described my behavior—my strengths and my weaknesses—which really shocked me. I was surprised at how accurately he understood me.
This made me reflect on one of my close relationships that last for about seven years. We used to fight frequently, mainly because I could not admit my mistakes. Instead of accepting my fault, I would give many reasons. I also realized that I often do not say what I actually want to say. I talk about other things and only answer the actual question at the end. This often makes the other person feel irritated.
That person used to tell me many times, “Why do you speak like this?” and it led to many conflicts. At that time, I believed that I was always right and thought others should not judge me. But today, after hearing similar feedback from sir, I realized that I may have made more mistakes than I understood earlier.
This realization helped me see my behavior more clearly and made me aware that I need to change how I communicate and accept responsibility.Today, from 7:00 to 8:30 at night, I went for a walk. During that time, I talked with my family members over the phone and also spent some time talking to my friend.
While walking and talking, I felt calm and relaxed. I realized that spending time with loved ones, even through a simple call, gives peace of mind and happiness. It helped me feel connected and grateful at the end of the day"
